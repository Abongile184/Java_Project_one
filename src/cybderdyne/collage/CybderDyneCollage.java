Cyberdyne Collage is a registered private institute of learning specializing in commerce and computing.
Ever since its inception in 2000, the collage administration has been using a manual system of records
for student enquiries, enrollment (using the old fashioned point system) and registration of new students.
All of the above mentioned procedures make use of the level arch filling system
This system has since become obsolete inconsistance and unreliable.
For Example: If the collage administration needs to go back to the students records he will need to go
and check on all the dusty files in the collage storeroom, sometimes this effort will be to no avail 
as some records cannot be found.
